ASSUME user is root/root

>>1. is copied from drone and assumed good
1. create schema dronescrashnburn manually
CREATE SCHEMA `dronescrashnburn`;
--executed ok

>>2. is copied from drone and assumed good
2. ensure user root really does have all priv
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dronescrashnburn.* TO 'root'@'localhost';
--executed ok

3. create the drone comment table
CREATE TABLE DRONE_COMMENT(
    commentId INT NOT NULL auto_increment,
    drone_id INT NOT NULL,
    comment_date date null,
    drone_comment_text VARCHAR(16000) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT fk_droneId
    FOREIGN KEY (drone_id) 
        REFERENCES DRONE(droneId)
        ON DELETE cascade
        ON UPDATE no action,
    PRIMARY KEY (commentId)
);
-- first excution was ok!?

4. inspect records in drone comment table - choose
select * from drone_comment order by commentId;
select * from drone_comment order by drone_id;
select * from drone_comment order by drone_id, commentId;
-- they execute ok and work as expected

5. create a dummy drone comment records - must sync with dummy dronesas follows:
one comment for dummy 1
no comment for dummy 2
two comments for dummy 3
one big comment for dummy 4

INSERT INTO `drone_comment`(drone_id, comment_date, drone_comment_text)
 VALUES (4, "2020/01/31",  "DB Comment A for drone id 4 LOTS OF TEXT -> \r\n  Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist- I really believe he is Antichrist- I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my 'faithful slave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you- sit down and tell me all the news. \r\n It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\r\n All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\r\n If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10- Annette Scherer. \r\n Heavens! what a virulent attack! replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.\r\n ");

6. in case of oops:
drop table DRONE_COMMENT;
commit;
				
7. select by drone id:
select * from drone_comment
where drone_comment.drone_id
in (select droneId from drone)
order by drone_comment.drone_id;

8. detect (count) dangling comments - should never happen:
select count(*) from drone_comment 
where drone_comment.drone_id 
not in (select droneId from drone);
